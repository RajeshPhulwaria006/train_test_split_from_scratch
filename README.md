# Custom Train-Test Split Using NumPy

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a **basic version of `train_test_split` from scratch using NumPy**.  
The purpose is **educational** : to understand how dataset splitting, shuffling, and indexing work internally in machine learning workflows.

This is **not a replacement** for `sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split`. It is a learning exercise to build intuition.
